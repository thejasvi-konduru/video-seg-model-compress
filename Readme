Pytorch Implementation of Imagenet classification using RBGP Framework:

How to run: 
  
  1. Run the semseg_*.sh bash file to train the model.
  2. Change the values of the preferred model in the bash file along with the learning rates, epochs and outer, inner sparsities etc. 
  3. This will run the semantic_seg.py file to train the model. 
  
Models Trained:
  1. Support for resnet18 and resnet54 backbone architectures is implemented. 
  2. Find the tensorboard graphs or log outputs for log files and validation graphs.
