Pytorch Implementation of Imagenet classification using RBGP Framework:

How to run: 
  
  1. Run the batch_run.py file to generate the complete command(along with arguments generated as per the values).
  2. Change the values of the preferred model in the batch_run file along with the learning rates, epochs and outer, inner sparsities etc. 
  3. Now copy the command and paste it into the terminal which will run the main.py file 
  
Models Trained:
  1. Support for all Resnet variations and mobilenets is present. 
  2. Have successfully run on resnet18 and MobileNetV2 on imagenet along with resnet50 and resnet18 for CIFAR datasets.
